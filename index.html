            <p>When talking about Christmas dishes with a friend, <br> she mentioned that <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19017/chocolate-trifle/"> trifles</a> are a tradition in her fiance's home. <br> This inspired me to make my own, as I always thought <br> they looked delicious!</bnr></p>

            <p>A close friend of mine from Germany told me how <br> she loved the taste of her grandmother's <a href="https://www.backenmachtgluecklich.de/rezepte/super-saftiger-sprudelkuchen-vom-blech-selterskuchen.html"><i>selterskuchen</i></a>, <br> and it sounded so tasty that I wanted to make one myself!</p>

        <p>My brother had asked me to make a pie for his <br><i>Dungeons & Dragons</i>-themed birthday party. This one was <br> specifically from a <a href="https://a.co/d/dpRskBR"> D&D-licensed cookbook. </a></p>

            <h2><em>Hello, it's nice to meet you!</em></h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Aaliyah</strong>, or Liya for short if that's easier to say! I'm excited to learn how to make websites in this course. I apologize if this website is a bit ugly, but the ugliness here at the beginning of everything only makes me more excited about what's to come— I'm looking forward to eventually learning about how to make webpages look nice, too!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some random tidbits about this site's author (me!):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I currently work as a photographer!</li>
                <li>I grew up in San Antonio, Texas for almost my entire life, but I'm originally from Las Vegas, Nevada.</li>
                <li>Every weekend, my friends and I get together for a weekly movie night to hopefully one day be able to call ourselves film buffs (or at least expand the list of films we've seen. These past three weeks, we've watched <i>The Black Phone</i>, <i>The Notebook</i>, and <i>Argo</i>.</li>
                <li>Some other hobbies of mine include roller-skating, playing games, and going on walks.</li>
            </ul>

             <br><p>I'd like to eventually turn this site into a full-on recipe diary, but for now, I'll keep you updated with some of the things I've made in the past and during the process of working on this website! 
                <br>Information and sources for the recipes I referenced while making them can be visited by clicking on their pictures or links.
